Jessica Arseneau’s artworks gently transport us to an in-between state, midway between wakefulness and sleep, physical and virtual, dream and reality. Through video installations and sculptures, Arseneau delves into our perception of time and reality, and into the economics of attention in the era of globalization and digitization, drawing inspiration from the theories of American philosopher Jonathan Crary. Themes arising from science fiction, alternative realities, and dystopian worlds such as those imagined by author J. G. Ballard also play an essential role in her approach. Her works are deployed within a meticulously designed light and sound ambience that is at once enveloping, disorienting, and slightly discomfiting. She plumbs subjects such as invasive artificial light and sleep deprivation, as well as their effects on biorhythms and wellbeing.

Her work walks the line between the conscious and the unconscious. Starting from still or filmed images, she creates atmospheres and enhances them with other elements such as light, sound, or text. Often taking inspiration by science ficiton, mythology, or an imagined future, her pieces unfold at an extremely slow pace, sometimes in suspended time, opening fictional spaces dominated by their own tensions.
