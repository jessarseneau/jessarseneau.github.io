<br></br>
Jessica Arseneau's artistic work delicately transports us to a state of in-between, halfway between two worlds: awake and asleep, physical and virtual, dream and reality. Through video installations and sculptures, her works unfold within a meticulously conceived atmosphere of light and sound, at once enveloping, unsettling and slightly unsettling.
<br></br>
The artist is interested in our perception of time and reality, as well as the economy of attention in the age of globalization and digitization, drawing inspiration in particular from the theories of American philosopher Jonathan Crary. Themes from science fiction, alternative realities and dystopian universes, such as those imagined by writer J.G. Ballard, also play an essential role in her approach. Her works explore issues such as the invasion of artificial light into our lives and sleep deprivation, and their repercussions on our biological rhythms and well-being.

<br></br>
Jessica Arseneau's practice is multidisciplinary, however video projection is usually the starting point for an installation accompanied by sound, texts, lights and photographs to construct an atmospheric space. For her work, she examines, among other things, how technological progress shapes the human experience and transforms the natural rhythms. She draws on science fiction narratives, mythologies, the imagination of the future and critical observations that she activates in the various components of the work.  The atmospheric nature of the exhibition space is used so that it acquires its own temporality. Artificial and natural light as much as darkness, both as medium and image is a subject of continuous exploration. It contributes to the enveloping atmosphere which often has a poetic and cinematic character in a broad sense. Poetry carries a structure of rationality within the work or exhibition space and acts as a catalyst for conceptual and formal elements.
